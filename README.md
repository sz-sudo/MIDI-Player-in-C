# MIDI-Player-in-C
This is a MIDI player written in C. It can only support one type of MIDI files. It was developed for educational purposes and was published hoping it might help others. 

For description and dependecies, please take a look at the "Dependecies and description" folder. Some of the documentation is in Persian/Farsi. I will translate them into English if I ever have the time.
